NAME
       binkd  -  transfer  files between two Fidonet systems over
       TCP/IP

SYNOPSIS
       binkd [-CcDipqrsvmh] [ -P node ] config-file

DESCRIPTION
       Binkd is a Fidonet mailer designed to operate  via  TCP/IP
       networks.  As  a  FTN-compatible internet daemon, it makes
       possible efficient utilization of TCP/IP protocol suite as
       a  transport  layer in FTN-based (Fido Technology Network)
       networks.

       Binkd expects your spool for Fido-like networks to  be  in
       BSO ("Bink style outbound") or optionaly ASO ("Amiga style
       outbound") format.  BSO is also used by ifmail  and  Bink-
       leyTerm mailers.


OPTIONS
       -C     Binkd running with this option will reread the con-
              figuration file if it is changed. The  modification
              time  of the configuration file is checked every 60
              seconds and on every incoming and outgoing  connec-
              tion.

       -c     Start  client  only.  Normally  Binkd  starts  both
              server and client.

       -D     Run Binkd as a daemon (cannot be used  for  client-
              only mode).

       -i     Run Binkd from inetd.

       -P     Poll  a  node.  An empty *.ilo file in the outbound
              will be created, which will force Binkd to  connect
              to  and  to receive mail from the node ( Binkd will
              also add "Node node * -" record  to  the  table-of-
              nodes  in  Binkd 's memory if there is no entry for
              the node in the configuration file).

       -p     Start client manager, process polls,  quit  if  the
              queue  seems  to  be  empty  after the next rescan.
              Implies -c.

       -q     Quiet mode. Turns off printq, conlog  and  percents
              statements of configuration.

       -r     Disable crypt traffic.

       -s     Start  server  only.  Normally  Binkd  starts  both
              server and client.

       -v     Be verbose.  Binkd -v will dump binkd's version and
              quit.

       -m     Disable CRAM-MD5 authorization. Implies -r.

       -h     Print help message.


SIGNALS
