NAME
       binkd  -  transfer  files between two Fidonet systems over
       TCP/IP

SYNOPSIS
       binkd [-Ccipqsv] [ -P node ] config-file

DESCRIPTION
       Binkd is a Fidonet mailer designed to operate  via  TCP/IP
       networks.  As  a  FTN-compatible internet daemon, it makes
       possible efficient utilization of TCP/IP protocol suite as
       a  transport  layer in FTN-based (Fido Technology Network)
       networks.

       Binkd expects your spool for Fido-like networks to  be  in
       BSO  ("Bink  style  outbound") format. BSO is also used by
       ifmail and BinkleyTerm mailers.


OPTIONS
       -C     Binkd running  with  this  option  will  exit  with
              return  code  3  when  the  configuration  file  is
              changed. The configuration file is checked every 60
              seconds.

       -c     Start  client  only.  Normally  Binkd  starts  both
              server and client.

       -i     Run Binkd from inetd.  Don't forget either to  com-
              ment  out printq, conlog and percents from the con-
              figuration file or to use -q option.

       -P     Poll a node.  An empty *.ilo file in  the  outbound
              will  be created, which will force Binkd to connect
              to and to receive mail from the node (  Binkd  will
              also  add  "Node  node * -" record to the table-of-
              nodes in Binkd 's memory if there is no  entry  for
              the node in the configuration file).

       -p     Start  client  manager,  process polls, quit if the
              queue seems to be  empty  after  the  next  rescan.
              Implies -c.

       -q     Quiet  mode.  Turns off printq, conlog and percents
              statements of configuration.

       -s     Start  server  only.  Normally  Binkd  starts  both
              server and client.

       -v     Be verbose.  Binkd -v will dump binkd's version and
              quit.
